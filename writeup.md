## Motivation
we want to build this application because it would make it easier for the user to be able to access games that he/she enjoys playing,without searching or looking up games that the user might not like after the search. This application has built-in games which reduces the userâ€™s stress of looking for interesting games to play. 

In creating this application, We hope to gain knowledge used in programming complex games and applications. We want to have personal introductions to video game programming using Pygame and create near life computer players by learning how to mimic the randomness of a real game. 
We want to have the experience in order to be ready for what the future has in store for us(internships, competitions etc.). 

In addition, our motivation for this project is simply our restless minds. We need to keep learning in order for us to achieve th best score possible. We needed to make use of python, google, pygames, and other extensions and modules to achieve he best result we could.


##Challenges
We didn't have any guidelines for the project except to do what we felt would be a good expression of our skills. Picking games to play was a good chioce but it meant we had to fully understand the functionality of code to make decisions.
Most concepts like classes and inheritance were things we had to learn on the project. 
The most challenging part was to create the minmax AI player in TicTacToe. Understanding the concept of minimum error was something I had little to no exposure to. However, the internet had a wide variety of resources available to enable us to learn how to implement it in our programs.
Another challenge was deciding on what games we were going to make, because we did not want to make complex games in such a short time period for this project.


## Core Funtionality of final results 
The final results is more comprehensive and a better version of the Minimum Viable Product. Unlike the Minimum Viable Product we did not talk much about how this application was going to run, but presently, this program runs in such a way that it asks the user what game he/she wants to play and runs the game inputted.
